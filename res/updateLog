v0.2 (committed)
- added ability to switch pokemon in battle


v0.2.1 (committed)
- added a Dex class, holds static references to Pokemon / Attacks
- new: LaunchGame has the main method, calls MainGame which calls BattleGame
- added a StandardIO class to handle i/o operations
- MainGame now puts Battle in a loop
- (I accidentally created a creepypasta. The eevee won't stay dead.)

v0.2.2 (committed)
- fixed the zombie-eevee glitch
- (the player can still become a zombie; can send out a 0-hp pokemon)
	- fixed the player-zombie glitch
- type matchups (weaknesses/resistances) now exist and affect combat

v0.2.3
- added a method in Dex for generating random encounters
- MainGame will now randomize its wild pokemon
- (problem: no concept of "blacking out", crashes if you enter a fight w/o a non-fainted pokemon)
- minimal work on "location" functions
- added electric type
- gave Pokemon nicknames, supported in battles (caught pokemon can be given nicknames)

- (it's been too long, I should clean this up, 10/7/20)
- fleshing out the location features, Field and PokeCenter now have activities

v0.3.0
- game now has different locations for different activities
- problem: some input menus (e.g. keep playing?) enter infinite loops when given bad inputs
- problem: misc. io problems, mostly to-do with where dividers get printed
- fixed the blackout situation, kinda (you can't enter grass, but it won't take you to the pokemon center)
- made a wildEncounterArea class that serves as a generic encounter area
- made a Cave class, new encounter types, added as connection to start
- new types (flying, rock); new pokemon (swoobat, rolycoly); new moves (GUST, ROCKBLAST)
- made a Cliff encounterArea, place to fight the powerful Skarmory (currently just a flying type)
- made a menu that controls game activities {activity, travel, status, quit}

v0.4.0
- added an exp/level system, updates at end of battles, each level increases MaxHP stat
- implemented PP system, depletes / restores as expected
- pokemon can now be set to spawn at certain levels
- attacks can now be associated w/ specific audio clips
- added a text scroll feature, all print-lines go through StandardIO.println()
- fixed weird divider placement
- fixed poor handling of unexpected characters
- added an options menu, can adjust crawl speed
- added a local description, printed when doing runActivity()
- more sounds
- audio class can now be toggled to not play, change in options menu
- added atk, def stats (integrated w/ dmg processing, level-ups, pokebattle results)
- added Honey Area, added bug/poison/fairy,
- added STAB

v0.4.5
- changed some toStrings, more presentable
- recalibrated some numbers (stats, dmg processing)
- fixed "0-menus", menus now start at 1
- added a box for storing pokemon, infinite capacity, accessed in pokecenter
- pokemon can now be examined / swapped in pokemon status menu (MainGame)
- bug: atk/def aren't being set correctly
- fixed: atk/def are now set correctly (the Pokemon(other) constructor wasn't assigning stats)
- caught pokemon can now be sent to the player's box
- catching pokemon now gives exp
- test-feature: StandardIO can print from a file, skarmory ascii-art is printed before fights
- full-feature: Pokemon now keep references to ascii files, will print before encounters
- locked areas are now fully functional, will unlock after successfully completing an areas activity X times
- modifications to maps & encounters
- technically there's a save/load system now; it isn't very scalable, will likely be out of date very soon
