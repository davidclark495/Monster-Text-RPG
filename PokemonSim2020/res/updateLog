- problem: some input menus (e.g. keep playing?) enter infinite loops when given bad inputs

- fixed: atk/def are now set correctly (the Pokemon(other) constructor wasn't assigning stats)
- caught pokemon can now be sent to the player's box
- catching pokemon now gives exp

- full-feature: Pokemon now keep references to ascii files, will print before encounters
- locked areas are now fully functional, will unlock after successfully completing an areas activity X times

*****************************

v0.4.6.1												2022/07/14
- trying to clean up code
- moving IO, print lines out of model classes (i.e. Pokemon.java)
	- instead, methods that "print" will instead return a string
- standardizing "delay" calls from outside of StandardIO
	- can't specify a time, instead specify "short," "moderate," "long," etc.
	
v0.5
- significant changes to data encoding: now using .csv's
	- Pokemon, Evolutions, Moves, Learnsets, Places etc. are pulled from .csv's
