	- fixed the player-zombie glitch
- type matchups (weaknesses/resistances) now exist and affect combat

v0.2.3

v0.3.0

- problem: some input menus (e.g. keep playing?) enter infinite loops when given bad inputs

- made a Cave class, new encounter types, added as connection to start
- new types (flying, rock); new pokemon (swoobat, rolycoly); new moves (GUST, ROCKBLAST)
